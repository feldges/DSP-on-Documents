# DSP-on-Documents
This project contains:
- a notebook, in which we show how the DSP (Demonstrate-Search-Predict) framework can be applied to a document (Document Understanding),
- a Python file, which provides the same possibilities as the Jupyter Notebook, but with a friendly (Streamlit) interface.

When running the Streamlit file, be aware that you must:
- Activate the Information Retriever as an API (see Notebook for details) and add the exact URL to the Python code
- Enter your OpenAI API Key in the Python code
- Start the Streamlit using "streamlit run DSP on Documents Streamlit.py

Let me know if you face any issues.

Enjoy!
