    "In this article, we illustrate how to apply the DSP (\"Demonstrate-Search-Predict\") framework and its corresponding Python library, that were developed by the Stanford University (https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14024), to a \"document understanding\" use case. In the original demo, the framework has been applied to Wikipedia. In this article we apply it to our own document (a pdf). We chose a legal document (an ideal candidate because there is a lot of text). But you should be able to apply this to any of your documents.\n",

    "This article is an extract from a Jupyter Notebook, which is available in GitHub (https://github.com/feldges/DSP-on-Documents). For more user-friendly use (especially for non-technical people), there is a Streamlit version of it (https://github.com/feldges/DSP-on-Documents/blob/main/DSP%20on%20Documents%20Streamlit.py).\n",

    "\n",
    "The goal of the text extraction is to split the text into chunks (or passages) that are aggregated in a relevant manner. \"Relevant\" is not precisely defined, but let's think what makes sense. First, let's think ahead: the passages will be injected as context to a Large Language Model. This means, the size must be limited, due to the limitation of the current language models. And the passages should be split in a way that makes sense. For example, a sentence should not be split in the middle. The way we decide to split the passages is to split them by legal article. In addition, it is important to understand that the title, section, chapter, and article names might be important (sort of metadata), and not only the text. It is why, when we create the passages, we also inject the title, section, chapter, and article names with it. You can see more details below, on how we did it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we know what we want. Is the implementation simple? Unfortunately not. Looking at the pdf document, we see that there is text all over the place! Headers, footnotes, ... \n",
    "\n",
    "So let's dive into it. There are many libraries that allow text extraction in Python, many of which are very similar, but yet different. The library langchain also offers a wrapper around many of these libraries. But instead of using langchain, we will use the original library, PyMuPDF, because it offers more flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will put special care for this step. Unfortunately this step is typically customized to the document we are using, and a generalization of this extraction to any pdf files can be painful. But still, we make the extra effort to have a clean text extraction, since it is key to get good results for our search engine. You can have the best search engine (which we have in this example!), but if you provide it with poor quality data, you will get poor results.\n",

    "We can say that this is rather fast! How is it possible to get a semantic search that is so fast? This has to do with the approach. The method is based on BERT, however, at inference time (at time of search), only the query has to be encoded by the BERT algorithm. The passages have been encoded by BERT at time of indexing (which happens only once), not at time of inference. How is it then possible to still have a BERT-based search algorithm? This is because of late interactions. The embedding of every single token that comes out of BERT is used, for both the query and the passages. These embedding are \"compared\" with a very simple algorithm (just additions and multiplications). These \"comparisons\" are called \"late interactions\", because they occur late in the encoding process (after the tokens have gone through all the transformers of BERT). How can the comparison be done between the query and all the (potentially million of) passages? The way the passages are stored makes this algorithm faster: instead of going through each passages, the algorithm can afford to go through only selected passages, because, remember, these are organized as clusters. ColBERTv2 is part of the family of models called late interaction.\n",

    "There are alternatives search algorithms. One algorithm which is very popular is a \"passage embedding\" (for example the ADA embeddings from OpenAI). These algorithms are very well integrated with popular frameworks like Langchain, and are also well integrated with vector databases like Pinecone.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have used both search algorithms, and my (subjective) impression is that late interaction models work much better than passage embeddings. The interpretation I give to this observation is that late interaction models look at each single word (more precisely: token), while passage embedding looks at a passage as a whole. The much deeper granularity of late interaction models can act very positively on the quality of the search. Unfortunately I have no evidence to support my impression, so I will keep it as a \"subjective\" impression! But I would love to hear quantitative comparisons, if you know of any."

    "Let's summarize what we have done: we asked a question, retrieved relevant passages to our question, injected these into an LLM, and let the LLM answer the question. We are using the S-Search and P-Predict of the DSP framework. Let's look at how to use the D-Demonstrate part. In our case it works well without examples, but let's still add them. This should allow us to better format the answer."

Article 112 states that the Cantons shall provide for assistance and care in the home for elderly people and people with disabilities.

    "In this article we have gone through the DSP framework and illustrated it with a concrete example, that we have developed in detail. The goal is to illustrate the use of this framework for a document, which means applying the DSP framework to a \"document understanding\" use case. And it works very well!\n",
    "\n",
    "We have used only very limited possibilities of the DSP framework. In the DSP GitHub repo (https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dsp), you can find much more sophisticated uses of it. For example, you can build algorithms that will ask several questions and iteratively retrieve information from passages. But in our simple case this is not needed, so I have skipped it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are still limitations to this framework. For example, the retriever was trained on English texts only, and on specific domain datasets. A lot of value could be added if the retriever were trained in other languages, and if it were trained on other domains, that are specific, for example, to your enterprise. We see a lot of potential for this!\n",
